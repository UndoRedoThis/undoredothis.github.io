				<h2>JSON and Javascript became one</h2>
				
				<p>That's right. JSON and Javascript finally marged into a good-looking markup-code-thingy. Believe it or not, every function and every object on this page was created using only one JSON object. You can right-click, view the page code and see for yourself. No, honestly, you should totally do that right now because I want you to believe me.</p>
				<p>Did you do it? Great. Let's move on.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<h2>What is JSONScript?</h2>
				
				<p>JSONScript converts JSON objects on your webpage into valid Javascript-usable objects, functions, numbers, strings or whatever you like. Defining a parsable object is simple. Just create an array filled with objects you want the JSONScript API to parse, pass it over and you're good to go.</p>
				
				<div class="codepreview">
					<code>JSONScript.parse([</code> 
					<code>    {</code>
					<code>        type : "object",</code>
					<code>        name : "myFirstJSONScriptObject"</code>
					<code>    }</code>
					<code>])</code>
				</div>
				
				<p>It's that simple. JSONScript takes care of everything you shouldn't worry about. It's a solid way of shrinking down your code and making it look beautiful.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<h2>Why should I use JSONScript?</h2>
				
				<h3>No need to worry about types</h3>
				
				<p>Yes. You heard me right. You, as a coder, simply need to do nothing more than give strings to the API to work with. Imagine the following. You need to have the number <span class="codepreview inline">123.45</span> stored for whatever reason. Since floats take up more space than integers, the API will first check whether the number actually needs to be represented as a float and then returns it according to the aforementioned condition. So there's indeed a difference between <span class="codepreview inline">123.45</span> and <span class="codepreview inline">123</span>. The API handles it incredibly well and makes your code run faster.</p>
			
				<h3>It's beautiful</h3>
				
				<p>JSON is beautiful and I think you know that this is a fact and not an opinion.</p>
				
				<h3>{$USAGE_REASON_3}</h3>
				
				<p>{$USAGE_REASON_SO_THEY_DOWNLOAD_THIS_CRAP_3}</p>
				
				<h3>Safe eval()</h3>
				
				<p>Nothing bad will happen to your code since the <span class="codepreview inline">eval()</span> calls which the API requires are deeply nested in functions which can't be accessed from the outside. Hacking is almost impossible due to high security standards and we do our best in order to make the API even safer in the future.</p>
